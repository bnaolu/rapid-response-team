# Presentation Template

## Overview

In preparation for our talks at DC Design Week and Creative Mornings, we decided to showcase our work and content in a web-based format. 

## Problem

The team at DC Design Week provided an accessibility course where we discovered that typical presentations tools can cause various challenges and exclude a large portion of our audience if not properly accounted for. 

## Solution

The purpose of this project is to enable Bixalers to create presentation content using a webpage instead of tools like Google Slides or PowerPoint.

### Why would you want to do this? Here are a few reasons:

- Inherently more accessible and responsive
- Robust version control and collaboration tools with GitHub
- Better separation of content and presentation
- More open and shareable
- More fun

## Results

Features include common templates, Bixal brand fonts and colors, example slides, automatic slide counts and next slide links, and an easily accessible page to presenter notes.

## Tools used

- Bixal brand fonts and colors
- USWDS
- GitHub
- Jekyll

## Reflection

You know all those times we wondered if our presentation had enough memes or animations? Turns out they weren't needed because **simple is best**. 

Accessibility is important. Be sure to reference the [A11y checklist](https://www.a11yproject.com/checklist/) for your next presentation.
