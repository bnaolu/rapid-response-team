# Data Privacy Challenge

## Overview

The Rapid Response Team decided to enter a challenge posted on [challenge.gov]() for a chance to win $20,000! Spoiler alert: we did not win.

The challenge offered us the opportunity to come up with a creative solution for companies looking to earn their data privcay certification. The certification would allow them more opportunities to trade goods internationally and instill trust in the consumers. The three main people involved in this process are the:

- Certifying body
- Certifying agent
- Company trying to be certified

## Problem

The challenge was poorly written. They were already offering specific solutions to the problem, jumpng to conclusinos

## Solution

## Results

## Tools

The challenge rules required us to create the prototype in Figma. We used FlowMapp to synthesize research and create deliverables such as user flows, site maps and personas. We collaborated in Microsoft Teams and Github.

## Reflection

This challenge gave us the chance to think through how to simplify complicated processes with a user-centered mindset. Each person involved in the process had specific goals and needs that had to be addressed in the design. The final product is a display of lots team collaboration to ideate creative solutions to complex problems. While the material might have been a bit dry, the process and problem solving was gave this challenge some flavor.
