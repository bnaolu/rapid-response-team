# Onboarding New Designers

## Overview

## Problem

The design team at Bixal needs more clarity around roles, responsibilities, and how the design team will operate as it continues to expand. Recent hires on the team expressed a longing for a more standardized onboarding process equipped with a proper introduction to folks on the team, an organization chart, a consolidated list of resources, and a warm welcome.

At the start of this project, the design team will be hiring seven new designers. The hiring process in the current job market has become increasingly difficult. We know that most designers have multiple offers, making it even more important that we stay competitive and when we eventually bring on a new teammate, they should feel that they’ve made the right decision and are happy with their choice. Creating a joyful and thorough onboarding process can be an exciting start for new hires. It can help them easily access all the necessary resources and manage their expectations of what’s to come.

We can take inspiration from companies like InVision who have adopted an interactive, exciting onboarding experience. New hires at InVision receive an interactive file that functions as a home for all the onboarding material they need, a warm welcome and intro videos from the team, a roadmap for both the new hire and their manager, and a place for them to introduce themselves to the team by creating a personal mood board.

## Solution

Use an interactive tool, such as Miro, to create an onboarding experience for new hires.

Scope: The scope is subject to change based on information gathered in the research phase, but it could include

A calendar or roadmap
A checklist of onboarding tasks for both the new hire and manager
Intro video (or a photo and a written intro) by designers on the team
A board for the new hire to intro themselves; something like a moodboard
Teams channels
Team-specific materials, like their working agreement

## Tools

The onboarding experience was created in Miro. We chose Miro because it is a simple design tool that almost anyone can use without taking much time to learn how.
We collaborated in Microsoft Teams.
