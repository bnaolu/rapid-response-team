# USWDS Design Tokens Guide

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to provide lessons learned and guidance on how designers can progressively understand and apply the use of design tokens in their work â€” ultimately increasing adoption of the U.S. Web Design System among digital services teams working on government websites.

## Problem

Design tokens have been an important part of design systems for some time now. They allow for both useful constraints and creative flexibility when either building a new system or working within an existing one.

While designers seem generally familiar with design tokens and know that they are a part of the U.S. Web Design System, they are usually not incorporating the use of them in their workflows and collaboration with developers. Mostly all of the guidance currently available is geared to developers, not designers, making it more difficult to understand and use.

This is a missed opportunity to realize the full potential of USWDS and its role as a common language between design and implementation.

## Solution

Create a microsite to document guidance on how designers can progressively understand and apply the use of design tokens in their work.

The guide will include two main components:

- "[Maturity model](https://designsystem.digital.gov/maturity-model/)"-style content to document steps to increasing use of and benefit from design tokens.
- Learning resources (some interactive in things like Figma and Codepen) to further gain understanding of design tokens.

## Tools

This project was created using Github, Jekyll, HTML, markdown and the United States Web Design System. We used Figma to ideate and Github and Microsoft Teams to collaborate.

## Reflection

I thought I new about design tokens until I sat down to try to write a guide about to how to use them. The best way to truly learn a concept is to teach it.
