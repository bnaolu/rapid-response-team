# USWDS Design Tokens Guide

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to provide lessons learned and guidance on how designers can progressively understand and apply the use of design tokens in their work â€” ultimately increasing adoption of the U.S. Web Design System among digital services teams working on government websites.

## Problem

Design tokens have been an important part of design systems for some time now. They allow for both useful constraints and creative flexibility when either building a new system or working within an existing one. While designers seem generally familiar that design tokens are a part of the U.S. Web Design System, there don't appear to be good practices around incorporating the use of them into design tool workflows and collaboration with developers. This is a missed opportunity to realize the full potential of USWDS and its role as a common language between design and implementation.

## Solution

Our high-level solution is to create a microsite to document guidance on how designers can progressively understand and apply the use of design tokens in their work.

We see this solution consisting of two main components:

"Maturity model"-style content to document steps to increasing use of and benefit from design tokens.
Periodic "micro-blog" content with tips, tricks, and resources.
