# Navigation Test Drive

## Overview

By overlaying a custom navigation component on top of an iframe of an existing site, you could do content and information architecture prototyping quickly and easily on a live site by editing the navigation and URLs. Like test driving a new car, you'd instead be able to test "drive" a new navigation.

The value proposition of this project is that it's useful to be able to try out new navigation models on an existing site without coding or managing content.

## Results

### Gathering feedback

We were curious to know how our audience (UX researchers and designers, and content strategist) would respond to this concept. To gauge their interest, we quickly set up a pseudo-site to look like a SaaS product page.

The feedback:

- *"Yeah, sounds like a cool idea. I was curious. I like the idea of being able to overlay a new navigation and see how it might work..."*
- *"Generally I dig the idea of doing a tree test in context of the actual site."*
- *"We're planning to set up a tree test and have them and users do it, but something like this would provide richer data because we'd capture insights about the interface challenges that might also hinder someone finding a page."*
- *"Clients get stuck in their thinking, and this is an interesting, incremental way to introduce new ideas."*

### The navigation template tool

The template includes instructions on getting started and requires no knowledge of code whatsoever. Simply plug in your content and enjoy that new nav smell.

## Tools used

- USWDS
- GitHub
- Jekyll

## Reflection

Unlike most of our projects that contained a problem-solution approach, this project took an idea that we believed could help our intended audiences and experimented with it. Working on this project gave us the opportunity to continue creating reusable templates for our in-house team at Bixal.
